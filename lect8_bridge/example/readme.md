## Devices and remote controls (Example)
This example shows separtation between classes of remotes and devices that they control

Remote act as abstractions, and devices are their implementations. Thanks to the common interfaces, the same remotes can work with different devices and vice versa

The Bridge pattern allows changing or even creating new classes without touching the code of the opposite hierarchy
